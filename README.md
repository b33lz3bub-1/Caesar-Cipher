# Caesar-Cipher

CAESAR CIPHER : 

	In cryptography, a Caesar cipher is the shift cipher where each latter are replaced by a given
	key or you can say a given number.
	
	For Example

		Lets say we wan to replace the following word by a shift of 3 (or with key = 3)
		
		DOG -> ALD
		
		Here D is converted to A because if we go backward from D then we will find that
		the third letter after D is A.
		
		Samee for O, if we go backward from O then we will find that the third letter 
		after O is L.
		
		Same for G, if we go backward from D then we will find that the third letter
		after G is D.

	So if we see the table of letters with a key of 3
